Time investment / week: >=3 hours total (reasonable?)

  * 15-30 min research (if more than this is needed, it's time to talk to someone)
  * 30 min - 1 hr getting help, talking to people
  * 90 min - 2 hr "solo" work (must be spent accomplishing things vs. floundering/struggling with things)

# Deliverables and Dates

## May 26

### Deliverables

 * Branch in CanJS
 * Open issue in CanJS for discussion, including timeline
 * Test page
 * Detailed plan based on how benchmarking works

#### Test page

  * Test cases (failing)
  * Stache template example

#### Performance plan

* Detailed plan for benchmarking performance
    * How do we do this with CanJS ([How do benchmarks work](https://github.com/bitovi/canjs/blob/master/test/benchmarks.js))
    * Do we need something special for Dirty Checking?
    * What's our goal look like?

### Need help with

 * Identifying test cases
 * Advice on who to talk to for:
    * Testing
    * Benchmarking/performance
 * Clarifying dirty vs. lazy
 * Confirming overall plan makes sense

## June 2

### Deliverables:

 * Incorporation of Observe-JS or conclusively determine if it can't work (Mark)
 * IE8 plan for Observe-JS if applicable (Mark)
 * Revised plan if applicable
 * Object tests Passing

#### Observe-JS

May be at wrong abstraction layer, according to Mark--determine with him if we can't use it.

#### Revised Plan

Based on feedback from previous week/getting help, alter plan if necessary

#### Object Tests

All object tests are passing (Performance and Array Tests still coming)

### Need Help With
